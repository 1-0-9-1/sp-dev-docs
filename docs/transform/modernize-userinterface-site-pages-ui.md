# Transforming to modern site pages from inside the SharePoint UI

If you want to give your end users the option to self-service modernize pages then using the SharePoint Page Transformation UI makes a lot of sense as it offers your end users UI extensions (ribbon buttons) to launch page transformation:

A second key feature is that the UI integration also allows your end users to accept or discard the generated pages:
