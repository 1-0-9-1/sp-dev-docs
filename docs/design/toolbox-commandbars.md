# SharePoint toolbox and command bars

Becoming familiar with the toolbox and command bars in SharePoint will help you better understand the built-in SharePoint features and functionality, and enable you to create more engaging experiences. 
 
**Toolbox hint states and hint default**

The following image shows the Hover/Active and default status of the toolbox hints. 

<!-- I'm not clear about what this image is intended to convey to the user. Just the fact that the color changes on hover? Also, pls. check the intro sentence I added here. -->

**Hint active** 

The following image shows the toolbox with an active hint highlighted.

<!-- I think that these images would be more impactful if they showed real-world examples. -->

## Toolbars

<!-- Is toolbar the same thing as a command bar? Or, are we missing information here about the command bar? -->

The toolbars sit on the left side of all web parts. By default, edit and delete actions are always available as part of the framework, to allow users to open the web part properties pane and to delete the web part from the page.
