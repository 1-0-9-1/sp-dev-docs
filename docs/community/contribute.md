* Report and fix issues on the GitHub repositories at [SharePoint GitHub Organization](http://github.com/sharepoint)
* Report issues in the GitHub issue lists for helping others to find where they can assist
* Provide input on the new feature requests at the [SharePoint Developer UserVoice](https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329220-sharepoint-dev-platform)

## FAQ

**Why would I contribute?**

Contributing to the official articles, samples and open-source projects will ensure that your work will get the maximal visibility through the official channels from Microsoft. We will also acknowledge your contribution in the monthly summary (see Contributors in [March 2018](https://dev.office.com/blogs/pnp-march-2018-update) update as an example). We also can acknowledge your company if you send your company logo and permission to use that to us.

**Why won't you link samples from my repositories?**

This is due liability reasons. As samples are linked also in the official SharePoint Developer portal, we will need to ensure that we control the content around the information published within the samples. We can't cross-link to non-Microsoft controlled repositories or articles, as we dont' control that content and we need to gurantee that information is there as long as it's cross-linked in Microsoft controlled sites.

If you contribute on the SharePoint GitHub organization, we'll absolutely make maintenance of your samples also easy for you.

**I've built cool SharePoint Dev sample, can I contribute?**

Absolutely. Just submit a pull request to the right GitHub repository and we'll get your contribution processed typically in matter of days.

**We are working on cool guidance for SharePoint Dev, could we contribute that?**

Absolutely. Guidance and articles are also absolutely welcome where suitable. Let us know what you have and we can figure out the right model to get it published. There are some standards around the guidance which can be released, but we might even be able to use our technical writers for doing needed voice review for your submissions.

**I'd like to help, but not sure where to find suitable tasks or what to do?**

Here's few suggestions:

* Help to resolve some of the issues which are reported in the GitHub repositories
* Submit new samples on different repositories
* Suggest a live demo in one of the community calls

If you have other suggestions on how to contribute, don't hesitate to reach out and let us know.
