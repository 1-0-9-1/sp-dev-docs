SharePoint Framework, a Page and Part model enables fully supported client-side development for building SharePoint experiences, easy integration with the SharePoint data and support for open source tooling development.

We designed the SharePoint Framework to empower SharePoint developers both inside and outside Microsoft. Our engineers are building modern SharePoint experiences using the SharePoint Framework. You can use the same technology, tools and techniques we use to build more productive experiences and apps that are responsive and mobile-ready from day one.

You can use the following resources to get familiar with the SharePoint Framework toolchain.

## TypeScript
TypeScript is the primary language to build SharePoint client-side web parts. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. SharePoint client-side development tools are built using TypeScript classes, modules and interfaces to help developers build robust client-side web parts. 

Below are some resources to get started with TypeScript:
* TypeScript Quick Start
* TypeScript Playground
* TypeScript Handbook
* Engage with TypeScript Community
